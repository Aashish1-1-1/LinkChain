## LinkChain
A BlockChain of personal or professional links 

## Motivation
Just setting example for over engineering using blockchain for trival act of storing links ha ha 

## Need
No need just to learn what's up with this blockchain thing

## What did i learn
About blockchain a bit, go routine and concurrency models used channel to communicate between routines etc etc

## Disclaimer
Don't try this at home, time is valuable :/

## To try it
You can change links from main.go file at function MakeBlockChain()
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aashish1-1-1/LinkChain
sudo docker build -t linkchain .
sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 linkchain
```
## Question?
Is it scalable somehow?
